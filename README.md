# Hi there, I'm Gaurav Pandey! 👋

> *"Attention is all you need to train neural networks."*

I am a **B.Tech CSE Student** and aspiring **ML Engineer** who loves peeling back the layers of abstraction. My GitHub is dedicated to implementing complex architectures—from Object Detection to Generative AI—**entirely from scratch** to truly understand the mathematics behind them.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning: **MLOps (Docker/Kubernetes)** and **Advanced Agentic Workflows**.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a huge *One Piece* fan (waiting for Luffy's next power-up!).

###  Top "From Scratch" Implementations

I don't just use `.fit()`—I build the architecture. Here are my core projects:

####  Generative AI & Transformers
| Project | Description | Tech |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Vision_Transformer_PaliGemma](https://github.com/Cruciator18/Vision_Transformer_PaliGemma)** | Full PyTorch implementation of the **PaliGemma** Vision Transformer from scratch. | PyTorch, Transformers |
| **[Stable-Diffusion](https://github.com/Cruciator18/Stable-Diffusion)** | Coded a **Stable Diffusion** model from the ground up to understand latent diffusion. | PyTorch, Jupyter |
| **[GAN-in-PyTorch](https://github.com/Cruciator18/GAN-in-PyTorch)** | Implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks to generate synthetic data. | PyTorch, GANs |
| **[gpt-decoder-only](https://github.com/Cruciator18/gpt-decoder-only)** | Built a GPT-style decoder-only transformer to understand attention mechanisms. | Python |

####  Computer Vision
| Project | Description | Tech |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[YOLO-from-scratch](https://github.com/Cruciator18/YOLO-from-scratch)** | **Real-time object detection pipeline** trained entirely from scratch using the YOLOv11 Nano architecture. | Python, Custom CNN |
| **[Anamoly_Detector](https://github.com/Cruciator18/Anamoly_Detector)** | Industrial anomaly detection using a hybrid **CNN + LSTM** model on the MVTec Dataset. | CNN, LSTM, CV |
| **[Neural-Art-Style-Transfer](https://github.com/Cruciator18/Neural-Art-Style-Transfer)** | Applying artistic styles to images using deep neural networks. | Deep Learning |
